# Survey Data Analysis and Visualization of Washington State City Employees
This project focuses on analyzing survey response data from approximately 1,500 city employees in Washington State. 
The analysis aims to clean, prepare, and visualize the data to derive key insights for the HR leadership team.
## Objectives 
### Objective 1
a.	Calculate the minimum, maximum, count, and number of blanks for each numerical field
b.	Remove any records with blank responses
c.	Remove any records containing duplicate values across all fields
d.	Calculate the count or frequency of each value in the Department and Question fields, and standardize any inconsistencies you find
### Objective 2
a.	Create a new tab named Chart Source, and generate a unique list of survey questions
b.	For each question, calculate the count of records associated with each response type (1-4) and the average response, excluding zeros
c.	Add new columns to convert the counts into percentages, based on the total responses for 1, 2, 3 or 4
d.	Copy and paste the data as values, then sort the questions descending by average response
### Objective 3
a.	Visualize the percentages as a 100% stacked bar chart, showing the question with the highest average response at the top
b.	Update colors to shades of orange or red for negative responses (1,2), and shades of blue for positive responses (3,4)
c.	Add data labels and remove the x-axis, title and vertical gridlines, then format individual chart elements to improve readability
d.	Based on your findings, what insights or recommendations might you bring to the HR leadership team?
e.	BONUS: Modify the chart to vertically align the bars so that positive responses skew to the right and negative responses skew to the left (youâ€™ll need calculated columns)
